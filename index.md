## Welcome to djharvey's GitHub

This is where I store my personal projects. See below for what I've been working on lately.

### [TurboTax Windows 7 Warning Disabler](https://github.com/djharvey/TurboTaxWindows7WarningDisabler/#turbotax-windows-7-warning-disabler)

If you're tired of the TurboTax 2019 Windows 7 to Windows 10 update warning/nag screen, such as I was, maybe this application can help to disable it for each application launch.

This little console application is designed to go into the current user's AppData folder and modify the pertinent setting in the settings JSON file. A backup version of the file is also made in case you might need to restore it.

See the [repository page](https://github.com/djharvey/TurboTaxWindows7WarningDisabler/#turbotax-windows-7-warning-disabler) for more information

If (and only if) you have found my work helpful and feel so inclined, tips are always appreciated but never expected.
